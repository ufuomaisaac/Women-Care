            There are three stages of pregnancy every woman must pass through, namely: first trimester(conception to 12 weeks), second trimester(13 to 27 weeks),  third trimester (28 to 40 weeks). With each trimester comes a fairly distinct kind of transformation your body must go throughFirst trimester:In the first trimester, your baby\'s little body starts taking shape, and all those tiny organs begin to form. Meanwhile, your own body goes through some pretty big adjustments too. You might notice things like feeling queasy, super tired, and making more trips to the bathroom than usual. This stage is mostly filled with a lot of emotional and physical changes, which can be overwhelming (especially for the first timers). Furthermore, your hormones tend to be hyperactive during this stage, thereby contributing to these unpleasant pregnancy symptoms(such as frequent mood swings ) you will be experiencing.

🌍 Cervical Cancer: Global Facts & Prevention

Cervical cancer affects over 660,000 women every year and causes nearly 350,000 deaths, mostly in lower-income countries. It’s mainly caused by long-term infection with HPV types 16 and 18.

What helps prevent it?
• HPV vaccines before sexual activity
• Regular screenings (Pap smears, HPV tests)
• Healthy habits like not smoking

With action, we can save lives. Let’s close the gap between rich and poor countries and eliminate cervical cancer globally.

Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide, with over 660,000 new cases and nearly 349,000 deaths in 2022. It disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries—those with a low Human Development Index (HDI) experience twice the incidence and five times the mortality compared to high-HDI countries.

The primary cause is a persistent infection with high-risk HPV types 16 and 18, responsible for approximately 70% of cases. Most HPV infections resolve naturally, but chronic infections can lead to precancerous lesions.

Prevention strategies include:
• HPV vaccination (e.g., Gardasil 9 or Cervarix) before sexual debut to dramatically reduce risk
• Screening methods such as Pap smears, high-risk HPV testing, and visual inspection (especially in low-resource settings)
• Maintaining safe sexual practices, not smoking, and adopting a healthy lifestyle

Without intervention, the global burden of cervical cancer is projected to rise to approximately 760,000 new cases and 411,000 deaths by 2030.
